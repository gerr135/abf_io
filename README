This is a library for accessing electrophysiology data stored in
Axon's abf files. Both integer and floating abf formats are supported
At this point library should handle Gap Free and Episodic Stimulation modes for reading
reasonably well, although large files may cause some grief, as all data is read completely
into the memory. So, if you hit performance degradation with couple hundred MB large files
try adding more memory or swap space or try bugging me to add support for partial reads..

Similarly, writing is not supported yet, although is planned to be worked on soon..

The building of the project is done by the means of a quite basic Makefile. I will most
likely shift to gnat project files however, with even simplier Makefile to wrap up most
common targets..
At this point you can build the library by simply running make. Short overview of targets:

make  or  make all  -  will build lib with debugging turned on and without optimizations
use
make final  to build optimized version
and
make clean  to remove all generated .o and .ali files..
