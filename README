This is a library for accessing electrophysiology data stored in Axon's abf files.
Both integer and floating abf formats are supported. At this point library should handle
Gap Free and Episodic Stimulation modes for reading reasonably well, although large files
may cause some grief, as all data is read completely into the memory. So, if you hit
performance degradation with couple hundred MB large files try adding more memory or
swap space or try bugging me to add support for partial reads..

Writing is not supported yet. I may add it at some time in the future.

To build this, simply run make.
make clean is also provided.

NOTE: this is a rather old code, done circa 2000 for my PhD to be used by some tools to
process large abf files. On this initial import I simply cleaned it up a bit. Not yet tested extensively.
Also, this only supports ABF1.8 format as of now - 2.0 came out quite a bit later and I haven't
yet had a reason to port it. I also had some refactoring uder way, to clean up the code.
This is not yet integrated. I'll add this at some point, then I may look at reading ABF2.0
and writing ABF files.
